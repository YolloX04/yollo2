          I'd be the tree you find refuge in.<br>
          In the chill of winter's grasp,<br>
          I'd kindle a campfire to warm your soul within.<br><br>
          
          When icy winds from the north do blow,<br>
          I'd build a fortress to shelter you from the cold.<br>
          I aspire to be a steadfast wall,<br>
          Guarding your mind and body, as time unfolds."
